## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

I used pytorch to train my own CNN, which I designed from scratch to solve this problem. In this notebook I also applied transfer learning and used a pretrained ResNet50 models to gain a higher accuracy on the prediction accuracy.

__NOTE:__ In the notebook, you will need to train CNNs in PyTorch.  If your CNN is taking too long to train, you should consider to use a GPU-accelerated instance in the cloud.
